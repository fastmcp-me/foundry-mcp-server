# Foundry MCP Server

A simple, lightweight and fast MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides Solidity development capabilities using the Foundry toolchain (Forge, Cast, and Anvil).

![Foundry MCP Demo](./assets/analysis_gif.gif)

## Overview

This server connects LLM assistants to the Foundry ecosystem, enabling them to:

- Interact with nodes (local Anvil instances or remote RPC endpoints)
- Analyze smart contracts and blockchain data
- Perform common EVM operations using Cast
- Manage, deploy, and execute Solidity code and scripts
- Work with a persistent Forge workspace

## Features

### Network Interaction

- Start and manage local Anvil instances
- Connect to any remote network (just specify the RPC)
- Get network/chain information

### Contract Interaction

- Call contract functions (read-only)
- Send transactions to contracts (if `PRIVATE_KEY` is configured)
- Get transaction receipts
- Read contract storage
- Analyze transaction traces
- Retrieve contract ABIs and sources from block explorers

### Solidity Development

- Maintain a dedicated Forge workspace
- Create and edit Solidity files
- Install dependencies
- Run Forge scripts
- Deploy contracts

### Utility Functions

- Calculate contract addresses
- Check contract bytecode size
- Estimate gas costs
- Convert between units (hex to decimals, etc.,)
- Generate wallets
- Get event logs
- Lookup function and event signatures

### Smart Contract Analysis (Heimdall)

- Disassemble EVM bytecode into human-readable opcodes
- Decode raw calldata without requiring ABI
- Decompile EVM bytecode to Solidity source code and ABI
- Generate visual control flow graphs for EVM bytecode
- Detailed transaction inspection with calldata decoding and trace analysis

## Usage

The server is designed to be used as an MCP tool provider for MCP Clients. When connected to a client, it enables the clients(claude desktop, cursor, client, etc.,) to perform Solidity and onchain operations directly.


#### Requirements

- [Node.js v18+](https://nodejs.org)
- [Foundry toolchain](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) (Forge, Cast, Anvil)
- [Heimdall-rs](https://github.com/Jon-Becker/heimdall-rs) (for smart contract analysis)
  
### Manual Setup

1. Ensure Foundry tools (Forge, Cast, Anvil) are installed on your system:
   ```
   curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
   foundryup
   ```
2. Clone and build the server.

    ```sh
    bun i && bun build ./src/index.ts --outdir ./dist --target node
   
3. Update your client config (eg: Claude desktop):

```json
 "mcpServers": {
    "foundry": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "path/to/foundry-mcp-server/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "env" :{
        "PRIVATE_KEY": "0x1234",
      }
    }
 }
```

> [!NOTE]
> `PRIVATE_KEY` is optional 


### Setup using NPM Package

You can now install and run the server directly using npm:

#### Global Installation
```bash
npm install -g @pranesh.asp/foundry-mcp-server
```

#### Direct Usage with npx
```bash
npx @pranesh.asp/foundry-mcp-server
```

#### MCP Client Configuration

**Claude Code**

```bash
 claude mcp add-json foundry-mcp-server '{"type":"stdio","command":"npx","args":["@pranesh.asp/foundry-mcp-server"],"env":{"RPC_URL": "", ""PRIVATE_KEY":""}}'   
```

**Other MCP Clients (Cursor, Claude, Windsurf)**

Add to your MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "foundry": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@pranesh.asp/foundry-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "RPC_URL": "http://localhost:8545",
        "PRIVATE_KEY": "0x..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```


#### Configuration

The server supports the following environment variables:

- `RPC_URL`: Default RPC URL to use when none is specified (optional)
- `PRIVATE_KEY`: Private key to use for transactions (optional)

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not add keys with mainnet funds. Even though the code uses it safely, LLMs can hallicunate and send malicious transactions. 
> Use it only for testing/development purposes. DO NOT trust the LLM!!

### Workspace

The server maintains a persistent Forge workspace at `~/.mcp-foundry-workspace` for all Solidity files, scripts, and dependencies.

## Tools

### Anvil 

- `anvil_start`: Start a new Anvil instance
- `anvil_stop`: Stop a running Anvil instance
- `anvil_status`: Check if Anvil is running and get its status

### Cast  

- `cast_call`: Call a contract function (read-only)
- `cast_send`: Send a transaction to a contract function
- `cast_balance`: Check the ETH balance of an address
- `cast_receipt`: Get the transaction receipt
- `cast_storage`: Read contract storage at a specific slot
- `cast_run`: Run a published transaction in a local environment
- `cast_logs`: Get logs by signature or topic
- `cast_sig`: Get the selector for a function or event signature
- `cast_4byte`: Lookup function or event signature from the 4byte directory
- `cast_chain`: Get information about the current chain

### Forge

- `forge_script`: Run a Forge script from the workspace
- `install_dependency`: Install a dependency for the Forge workspace

### File Management

- `create_solidity_file`: Create or update a Solidity file in the workspace
- `read_file`: Read the content of a file from the workspace
- `list_files`: List files in the workspace

### Utilities

- `convert_eth_units`: Convert between EVM units (wei, gwei, hex)
- `compute_address`: Compute the address of a contract that would be deployed
- `contract_size`: Get the bytecode size of a deployed contract
- `estimate_gas`: Estimate the gas cost of a transaction

### Heimdall Analysis

- `heimdall_disassemble`: Disassemble EVM bytecode into human-readable opcodes
- `heimdall_decode`: Decode raw calldata without requiring ABI
- `heimdall_decompile`: Decompile EVM bytecode to Solidity source code and ABI
- `heimdall_cfg`: Generate visual control flow graph for EVM bytecode
- `heimdall_inspect`: Detailed inspection of Ethereum transactions

## Usage in Claude Desktop App ðŸŽ¯

Once the installation is complete, and the Claude desktop app is configured, you must completely close and re-open the Claude desktop app to see the tavily-mcp server. You should see a hammer icon in the bottom left of the app, indicating available MCP tools, you can click on the hammer icon to see more details on the available tools.

![Alt text](./assets/tools.png)

Now claude will have complete access to the foundry-mcp server. If you insert the below examples into the Claude desktop app, you should see the foundry-mcp server tools in action.

### Examples

1. **Transaction analysis**:
```
Can you analyze the transaction and explain what it does? 
https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcb73ad3116f19358e2e649d4dc801b7ae0590a47b8bb2e57a8e98b6daa5fb14b
```

2. **Querying Balances**:
```
Query the mainnet ETH and USDT balances for the wallet 0x195F46025a6926968a1b3275822096eB12D97E70.
```
3.  **Sending transactions**:
```
Transfer 0.5 USDC to 0x195F46025a6926968a1b3275822096eB12D97E70 on Mainnet. 
```

4. **Deploying contracts/Running scripts**:
```
Deploy a mock ERC20 contract to a local anvil instance and name it "Fire Coin".
```
